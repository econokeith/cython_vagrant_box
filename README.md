Vagrant_Cython_Box

<<<<<<< HEAD
I got tired of dealing with osx/gcc problems and made this box. Still testing it, but it downloads the main packages I use and automatically loads them into ipython notebook whenever I open a new a new notebook. ipython config files are in /vagrant/ folder and symlinked to the ones on the box. So, you can edit there. 

#To run this box: 

1. clone repository
2. vagrant up in the cloned folder
